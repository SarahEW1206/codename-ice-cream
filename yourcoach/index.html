                    <p>I'm Jennifer Walzer Berkowitz. Today I am a strategic business coach, trained on the Gazelles Strategic
                        Coaching platform, serving CEOs and organizations in South Florida. Read on to find out more about
                        the journey that brought me here.</p>

                    <p class="testimonialName">CEO 2 BE</p>
                    <p>
                        Growing up, I always wanted to be a CEO. When I was 18, I ordered a vanity license plate that said &quot;CEO 2 BE,&quot;
                        and when I graduated college, I scrawled the same phrase on my graduation cap to let the world know
                        where I was headed! In 2002, I founded Backup My Info! (BUMI), a premium online data backup and recovery
                        service for the financial services industry. </p>
                    <img src="/images/gradcap.jpg" id="gradCap">


                    <p class="testimonialName">Living the dream?</p>
                    <p>Within a few years of founding BUMI, I was running a successful business. My dream had come true, but
                        I couldn&#39;t enjoy my success. I was stressed-out and frustrated. I was working nonstop and much
                        of my time was spent living out painful clichés like &quot;being in the weeds&quot; and &quot;putting
                        out fires.&quot; I wanted to scale my business but I knew I had to fix things before that happened.
                    </p>
                    <p class="testimonialName">My A-ha Moment</p>
                    <p>Around that time, through the Entreprenuers Organization, I was introduced to the Gazelles methodologies.
                        I read
                        <em>Mastering the Rockefeller Habits</em>, by Gazelles founder Verne Harnish and I realized right away
                        that it was exactly what I needed to help achieve scalable growth for BUMI. I started interviewing
                        coaches and found the right one for me.</p>
                    <p class="testimonialName">A is for Accountability</p>
                    <p>The Gazelles coaching process changed everything for me and my BUMI team. My coach kicked us into gear
                        and forced me to ensure I had the right long-term strategy in place. We started by assessing the
                        problems specific to my business, and then worked to implement tried-and true strategic tools that
                        allowed us to move forward with accountability and total alignment.</p>
                    <p>The process enabled me to finally get past the self-created roadblocks that were preventing my business
                        from growing. It gave me and my team tangible goals and a plan to reach them by working together
                        with a unified vision. We hit our goals every single year after implementing the Gazelles methodology,
                        and I was finally able to experience growth, while having FUN in the process.</p>
                    <p class="testimonialName">Real, Tangible Results</p>
                    <p>As a result of the hard work my team and I put in to implement the Gazelles framework, BUMI earned media
                        mentions (NY Times, Wall Street Journal, Daily News, Crains Magazine, NY Enterprise Report), won
                        awards (Inc 5000, Best Places to work, Stevie Award for Entrepreneur of the Year, and more), and
                        ultimately became a valuable company that was worth acquiring.</p>
                    <p class="testimonialName">Freedom Goal&trade; Realized</p>
                    <p> In 2014, I got a call from a competitor that recognized that value. While I was having a blast with my
                        company (I was finally able to work ON my business rather than IN it), they gave me an offer I couldn’t
                        turn down. Ultimately, I had reached my Freedom Goal&trade;! I could retire and spend more time with
                        my family while pursuing professional interests and passions on my own terms.</p>

                    <p class="testimonialName">Paying it Forward</p>
                    <p>After I retired from BUMI, I spent two years volunteering as a coach for the Entrepreneurs Organization
                        Accelerator Program. This was a game changer for me, as I was able to continue to live my "why" -
                        making a positive impact in the lives of others - and I was once again reminded of the power of the
                        Gazelles method. I decided to launch a coaching business to help even more entrepreneurs benefit
                        from this powerful program.</p>
                    <p>I am here because I believe in this process and because I want to use my experience to make an impact
                        in the lives of others. I reached my personal Freedom Goal&trade; of being able to balance a fulfilling
                        professional venture with plenty of family time.</p>
                    <p class="testimonialName">What's Your Freedom Goal&trade;?</p>
                    <p>Maybe that sounds appealing to you. Maybe your Freedom Goal is something entirely different. Either way,
                        if you're too stressed, frazzled and confused right now to even begin to think of how to achieve
                        your goals, CONTACT ME. Let's talk about getting you on the path to success – the path to your own
                        Freedom Goal.

                        the process and steps they will need to take to get out of their own way and grow their business.
                        <br>
                        <br> Jennifer has a ton of credibility because she’s built, grown, scaled and successfully sold a business
                        by going through this process with herself and her team.
                        <br>
                        <br>What I love most about Jen is when you say you are going to do something she holds you accountable
                        and also gives you the tools to do it. Whenever I’m stuck, she’s someone I know who can very quickly
                        get me unstuck, usually by giving me the kick in the rear that I need!
                        <br>
                        <br>Another incredible quality Jen has is she keeps it simple and focused, so anything and everything
                        is possible. Finally, she has a huge heart, genuinely cares about people and has a curiousity about
                        others - all essential to being a good coach."</p>
