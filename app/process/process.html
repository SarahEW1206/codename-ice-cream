                    <p>My process is structured within the framework of the Gazelles International coaching association, which
                        uses growth tools derived from the book Scaling Up, by Gazelles founder Verne Harnish. Below is an
                        overview of what you'd experience as a client of R+J Advisory Group. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="processSubhead"> 1) Identifying Pain Points:</p>
                    <p>When I work with a client, my first step is to sit down and get to know you. I want to find out what's
                        frustrating you in your busines. What do you perceive as your biggest hurdles?</p>
                    <br>

                    <p class="processSubhead"> 2) Hearing from Your Team:</p>
                    <p>I'll also interview your executive team to get their perspective.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p class="processSubhead">3) Defining your Freedom Goal&trade;:</p>
                    <p>I will work with you to define your Freedom Goal&trade;. This is something that can be different for
                        everyone. Ultimately is the point you want to reach or marker you want to hit that will allow you
                        to finally say you're free from whatever it was that was holding you back in your business.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="processSubhead">4) Annual Meeting:</p>
                    <p>The next step is a 2-day annual meeting where we work on all aspects of your business, covering key points
                        such as: What do you want to look like in 3 years? What is stopping you from getting there? What
                        are your choke points?</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="processSubhead">5) Mapping Out the Strategy:</p>
                    <p>As a result of this meeting we develop a strategy to get you moving forward with your team aligned and
                        excited about this direction. We will identify specific projects and assign owners to be accountable
                        to them, as well as identifying interim goals that will assure the success of these projects.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="processSubhead">6) Ensuring Accountability:</p>
                    <p>We will have check-ins at regular intervals to make sure you and your team are meeting interim goals.</p>
                    <Br>
                    <p>Review the next four tabs&mdash;Strategy, Execution, People and Cash&mdash;to understand the importance
                        of these "Four Key Decisions" within the context of the Gazelles program, and preview the tools we
                        will use to tackle each one.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>For your business to be successful, you must know your core customer, clearly communicate your brand
                        promise and be able to state what sustainable growth looks like within the context of your business.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>We will use the One Page Strategic Plan to get you and your team aligned with your strategy.</p>

                    <p>Developing good and sustainable habits is the key to successful growth. It's easy to get excited about
                        a new direction, implement some new changes, and eventually fall back into old habits once things
                        are no longer shiny and new.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p> We will use the Gazelles Execution Checklist of ten habits to help you reduce, by up to 80%, the time
                        you spend on managing your business, giving you more time to spend on leadership and growth-oriented,
                        market-facing activities.

                    <p>Having the right people on board is key. You can't grow your business on your own. You also can't do
                        it with team members who aren't aligned towards the success of the company as a whole. This misalignment
                        can happen when or team doesn't have a clear understanding of your vision, or simply because someone
                        is not a good fit.</p>

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p>We will use Gazelles “People” tools to help you ensure that you have the right people on your team and
                        that your team members understand your vision and the role they play in it, with clear accountabilities
                        and metrics.

                    <p>Growth is not free. We will use the Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC), to calculate the length of time between
                        when you spend a dollar (marketing, design, rent, wages, etc.) to when that dollar comes back into
                        your business.</p>

                    <p>The Gazelles’ Cash Conversion tool outlines your business' cash cycle and helps you identify specific
                        ways to double operating cash flow over the next year.
