                    <br>
                    <p> "Jennifer is a process oriented ninja. She is skilled at coaching CEOs through the process of understanding
                        the process and steps they will need to take to get out of their own way and grow their business.
                        <br>
                        <br> Jennifer has a ton of credibility because she’s built, grown, scaled and successfully sold a business
                        by going through this process with herself and her team.
                        <br>
                        <br>What I love most about Jen is when you say you are going to do something she holds you accountable
                        and also gives you the tools to do it. Whenever I’m stuck, she’s someone I know who can very quickly
                        get me unstuck, usually by giving me the kick in the rear that I need!
                        <br>
                        <br>Another incredible quality Jen has is she keeps it simple and focused, so anything and everything
                        is possible. Finally, she has a huge heart, genuinely cares about people and has a curiousity about
                        others - all essential to being a good coach."</p>
