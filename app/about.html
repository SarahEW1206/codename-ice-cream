                    From the time I was young, my goal in life was to be a CEO, so you can imagine that when I finally launched my first really
                    successful company, Backup My Info!, I was proud and thrilled. I had passion and vision and an idea of
                    what I wanted this company to become. <br><br>The only problem was that, after a
                    while, I got a bit stuck. I found myself too involved in tasks that I logically knew a CEO shouldn't
                    be doing, but I just couldn't get myself out of the weeds. I wanted to be able to focus on actually growing
                    my company, but I didn't know how best to move forward. <br><br>Throughout my professional life, I've
                    always been involved in networking groups and sought mentoring advice from those who had been there,
                    done that. This time was no different; I hired coach from Gazelles International to help me map out the
                    way forward.<br><br>It wasn't a magic bullet and I didn't see results overnight, but that's not what
                    I was looking for. I thoroughly enjoyed the process of working side by side with my coach, building the
                    strategy that outlined the things I needed to work on and the steps I needed to take to build a better,
                    stronger, more valuable business.<br><br>I was able to clarify my vision for Backup My Info!, bring the
                    right team members to the table, and get those team members motivated and aligned to our goals. In the
                    end, I built a multi-million dollar company that was an attractive target for [acquisition?] and I was
                    able to move my family back to Florida where I'm from and pursue other business ventures. That was MY
                    Freedom Goal &trade; and I firmly believe I would not have achieved it without a coach.<br><br>As I continued
                    to talk to other CEOs, I heard them expressing the same frustrations and relaying similar challenges
                    to what I had experienced with BUMI. I knew that, based on my own experience, I had something to offer
                    them. I decided to be come a coach to pay it forward, so to speak. I'm now a member of the Gazelles International
                    community of coaches and I look forward to using their excellent resources, combined with my own personal
                    coaching style, to help you achieve your Freedom Goal&trade; for your business.
