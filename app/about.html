                    I’ve always wanted to be a CEO. When I was 18 years old, I got a license plate that said "CEO 2 BE" on it and when I graduated
                    college, I scrawled the letters "CEO" on my graduation cap to let the world know where I was headed!
                    In 2002 I started BUMI out of my apartment and made all the sacrifices that come with starting a business
                    – no social life, living on PB&J, little sleep. I was able to hit $1 Million within a few years of starting
                    the business but I was frustrated with my progress and unsatisfied with the life I was living. I was
                    working nonstop and much of my time was spent living out painful clichés like "being in the weeds," "getting
                    the wrong people on the bus" and "putting out fires." I wanted to build a scalable business but I knew
                    I had to fix some things before that happened. That’s around the time I learned about the Gazelles methodologies.
                    I read Scaling Up, by Gazelles founder Verne Harnish and believed that this could be exactly what I needed
                    to help me grow my business. I started interviewing coaches and found one who was a good fit for my company
                    and my personality. I found a great coach who worked with me and my team, kicking our tails into gear
                    and forcing me to ensure I had the right long-term strategy. The Gazelles coaching process changed everything
                    for me. My coach assessed the problems specific to my business, and then helped me implement tried-and
                    true strategic tools that allowed me and my team to move forward with accountability and total alignment.
                    It enabled me to finally get past the self-created roadblocks that were preventing my business from growing.
                    It gave me and my team tangible goals and a plan to reach them by working together with a unified vision.
                    We hit our goals every single year after implementing the Gazelles methodology, and I was finally able
                    to experience growth, while having FUN in the process. Thanks to coaching, BUMI earned media mentions
                    (NY Times, Wall Street Journal, Daily News, Crains Magazine, NY Enterprise Report), won awards (Inc 5000,
                    Best Places to work, Stevie Award for Entrepreneur of the Year, and more), and ultimately became a valuable
                    company that was worth acquiring. In 2014, I got a call from a competitor that recognized that value.
                    While I was having a blast with my company, they gave me an offer I couldn’t turn down. I was thrilled
                    when I sold BUMI. I had reached my Freedom GoalTM ! I could retire and spend more time with my family,
                    while pursuing professional interests and passions on my own terms. After I "retired," I spent two years
                    volunteering as a coach for the Accelerator Program. This was a game changer for me, as I was able to
                    continue to live my "why" - making a positive impact in the lives of others - and I was once again reminded
                    of the power of the Gazelles method. I decided to launch a coaching business to help even more entrepreneurs
                    benefit from this powerful program. I CHOOSE to coach because I believe in this process and because I
                    want to use my experience to make an impact in the lives of others. Because I worked with a Gazelles
                    coach, I can do that on MY OWN TERMS and balance my time between work and family. Maybe that sounds appealing
                    to you. Maybe your Freedom Goal is something entirely different. Either way, if you're too stressed,
                    frazzled and confused right now to even begin to think of how to achieve your goals, CONTACT ME. Let's
                    talk about getting you on the path to success – the path to your own Freedom Goal.
