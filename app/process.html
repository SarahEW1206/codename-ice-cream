                    I want to find out what's frustrating you in your busines. What do you perceive as your biggest hurdles?<br><br>                    2) Hearing from Your Team: I'll also interview your executive team to get their perspective.<br><br>3)
                    Defining your Freedom Goal: I will work with you to define your Freedom Goal&trade;. This is something
                    that can be different for everyone. Ultimately is the point you want to reach or marker you want to hit
                    that will allow you to finally say you're free from whatever it was that was holding you back in your
                    business.
                    <br><br> 4) Annual Meeting: The next step is a 2-day annual meeting where we work on all aspects of your
                    business, covering key points such as: What do you want to look like in 3 years? What is stopping you
                    from getting there? What are your choke points?<br><br>5) Mapping Out the Strategy: As a result of this
                    meeting we develop a strategy to get you moving forward with your team aligned and excited about this
                    direction. We will identify specific projects and assign owners to be accountable to them, as well as
                    identifying interim goals that will assure the success of these projects.<br>
                    <Br>6) Ensuring Accountability: We will have check-ins at regular intervals to make sure you and your team
                    are meeting interim goals.

                    The One Page Strategic Plan was developed by Verne Harnish in his book, Mastering the Rockefellar Habits. It's a concise
                    and powerful tool for outlining your vision and strategy using the four decisions of People, Strategy,
                    Execution and Cash.<br><br> This action-oriented plan will help you and your team
                    get aligned, stay focused, and be accountable, as you work toward common goals.<br><br>

                <div class="tab-pane" id="four" role="tabpanel">

                    These are the four critical business decisions that growth companies must get right to maximize their revenue, profit and
                    time. <br><br> People: Having the right people on board is key. You can't grow your
                    business on your own You also can't do it with team members who aren't aligned towards the success of
                    the company as a whole. This misalignment can happen when or team doesn't have a clear understanding
                    of your vision, or simply because someone is not a good fit.

                    <br><br> We will use Gazelles “People” tools to help you ensure that you have the right people on your
                    team and that your team members understand your vision and the role they play in it, with clear accountabilities
                    and metrics.
                    <br><br> Strategy: For your business to be successful, you must know your core customer, clearly communicate
                    your brand promise and be able to state what sustainable growth looks like within the context of your
                    business.

                    <br><br> This is where the One Page Strategic Plan will come into play, helping get you and your team
                    aligned with your strategy.
                    <br><br> Execution: Developing good and sustainable habits is the key to successful growth. It's easy
                    to get excited about a new direction, implement some new changes, and eventually fall back into old habits
                    once things are no longer shiny and new.
                    <br><br> We will use the Gazelles Execution Checklist of ten habits to help you reduce by up to 80% the
                    time you spend on managing your business, giving you more time to spend on leadership and growth-oriented,
                    market-facing activities.
                    <br><br> Cash: Growth is not free. We will use the Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC), to calculate the length
                    of time between when you spend a dollar (marketing, design, rent, wages, etc.) to when that dollar comes
                    back into your business.
                    <br><br>The Gazelles’ Cash Conversion tool outlines your business' cash cycle and helps you identify
                    specific ways to double operating cash flow over the next year.
