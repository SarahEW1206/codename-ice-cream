                    <p>My process is structured within the framework of the Gazelles International Coaching Organization, which
                        uses growth tools derived from the book
                        <em>Scaling Up</em>, by Gazelles founder Verne Harnish. The Gazelles platform is a tested and proven
                        framework used by thousands of companies (including my own). It&#39;s simple and it works. By using
                        the Gazelles program, you will have clear accountability and organizational alignment in your company.
                        Your team will feel empowered and productive because you will have a very clear roadmap to achieve
                        your goals, including defined, measurable checkpoints along the way. If you aren’t convinced yet,
                        just ask any of our very happy clients! Below is an overview of the process you can expect to experience
                        as a client of R+J Advisory Group. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="processSubhead"> 1) Identifying Pain Points:</p>
                    <p>When I work with a client, my first step is to sit down and get to know you. I want to find out what&#39;s
                        frustrating you in your business. I want to better understand what your biggest challenges and opportunities
                        are. Some questions I typically use as discussion starters (and don&#39;t worry if you don&#39;t
                        have answers to most if not all of these questions – most clients don&#39;t and that&#39;s why they&#39;ve
                        come to me!):</br>
                        <ul>
                            <li class="tabListItem"> What is your company’s growth strategy? Can you state it in a sentence? Does every employee know
                                how their role helps contribute to this?</li>
                            <li class="tabListItem"> If you had to start the company all over again tomorrow, would you enthusiastically rehire everyone
                                on your team? How about your vendors and partners?</li>
                            <li class="tabListItem"> Is there organizational clarity? Does everyone know what they are accountable for?</li>
                            <li class="tabListItem"> Are your managers focusing on the highest priority activities and keeping you informed of their
                                progress?
                            </li>
                            <li class="tabListItem"> How are you differentiating yourself in the market? Are your competitors taking over your market?</li>
                            <li class="tabListItem"> Are you focused on the products and services that are most profitable?</li>
                        </ul>

                    <br>

                    <p class="processSubhead"> 2) Hearing from Your Team:</p>
                    <p>I&#39;ll also interview your executive team to get their perspective.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p class="processSubhead">3) Defining your Freedom Goal&trade;:</p>
                    <p>I will work with you to define your Freedom Goal&trade;. This is something that can be different for
                        everyone. It is the point you want to reach or marker you want to hit that will allow you to finally
                        say you&#39;re free from whatever it was that was holding you back in your business.

                    <p class="processSubhead">4) Annual Meeting:</p>
                    <p>The next step is a 2-day annual meeting where we work on all aspects of your business, covering key points
                        such as: What do you want to look like in 3 years? What is stopping you from getting there? What
                        are your choke points?</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="processSubhead">5) Mapping Out the Strategy:</p>
                    <p>As a result of this meeting, we develop a strategy to get you moving forward with your team aligned and
                        excited about this direction. We will identify specific projects and assign owners to be accountable
                        to them and identify interim goals that will assure the success of these projects.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="processSubhead">6) Ensuring Accountability:</p>
                    <p>We will have check-ins at regular intervals to make sure you and your team are meeting interim goals.</p>

                    <p>If you had to state your company&#39;s strategy in one sentence, right now, what would you say? Did you
                        hesitate? Don&#39;t worry, many CEOs are in the same boat. That&#39;s why we&#39;ll work together
                        to define and outline key strategic components like your core customer, your brand promise and your
                        growth objectives.</p>

                        It&#39;s easy to get excited about a new direction, implement changes, and eventually fall back into
                        old habits once things are no longer shiny and new. Habits built under the Gazelles framework are
                        designed with the long term in mind. </p>

                        and reduce, by up to 80%, the time you spend on managing your business, giving you more time to spend
                        on leadership and growth-oriented, market-facing activities.

                    <p>Having the right people on board is key. You can&#39;t grow your business on your own. You also can&#39;t
                        do it with team members who aren&#39;t aligned towards the success of the company as a whole. This
                        misalignment can happen when your team doesn&#39;t have a clear understanding of your vision, or
                        simply because someone is not a good fit.</p>

                    <p>Growth is not free. You have to be willing to invest in yourself, your people and your business. To really
                        understand the effectiveness of these investments, you need to know your cashflow inside and out
                        and understand how and when the dollars that flow out should come back to you. The Gazelles Cash
                        Conversion tool outlines your business&#39; cash cycle and helps you identify specific ways to double
                        operating cash flow over the next year. </p>

                        <li class="tabListItem">Do you know exactly how long it takes for a dollar invested in your business to come back as a return?</li>
                        <li class="tabListItem">Do you have the right salespeople on your team? Do you know what the wrong ones are costing you?</li>
                        <li class="tabListItem">Do you have consistet cash sources fueling the growth of your business?</li>
                        <li class="tabListItem">What is the state of your sales pipeline today?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We will use the Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC), to calculate the length of time between when you spend a
                        dollar (marketing, design, rent, wages, etc.) to when that dollar comes back into your business.
